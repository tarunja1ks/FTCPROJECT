This is the github to our unique project for FTC Team Cyborg Daemons 19659
Our unique code is mainly used in the autonomous period of the robot game.
Reason we made this:
  Initially in the first meets we would often crash into alliance robots due to lack of miscommunication 
  and had a hard time making code on the spot to go with the alliances plan. Due to this, we made a primitive version of self driving to complete missions for our robot.
 
 
 *****
 Currently---------------------
 *****
 Our code is using and algorithim called BFS(Breadth First Search), which we have had experience with in competitive programming.
 Currently, this self driving system can only go in perpiniduclar or linear movements meaning it can turn at a 70 angle or something similar. 
 It is also very risky to use this as it isn't very advanced right now. It can still work for many missions and can navigate it's way through the map.
 Here is an example video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jAU79Zr-MtuWbw-sfpwtUQUmlLvw6nCT/view?usp=sharing 
 We also use a GUI for the alliance to input their path with a visual to make it more simple. 
 
 
 *****
 Potential-----------------
 ****
 Potential this program has is using AI to help with its selfdriving instead of BFS. It can use AI and a 
 webcam to detect robots in realtime(with object dection) so both robots don't collide into each other. We can also try to use a method, which allows more 
 effieicent paths that don't have to be going in 90,180,270,or 360 turn increments.
